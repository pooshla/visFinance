It's easy to lose track of where all your money goes each month. Whether its retirement contributions, monthly subscriptions, or even your taxes, 
VisFinance can help! VisFinance is a tool for visualizing where your money goes each month, and to allow you to make modifications to see the impact
to various categories or your savings!

## Setup

VisFinance is a basic thin web application, so there's no installation! All you need is a browser!

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/pooshla/visFinance/releases)
2. Unzip the downloaded folder and open index.html with your favorite browser

## Contributing

This is an early stage project, so ideas are welcome. You can submit bugs and ideas [here](https://github.com/pooshla/visFinance/issues)

## Localization

This tool is currently based on Anne Arundel County, Maryland in the United States. If you would like another state, county, or country added, create a ticket and hopefully over time the list of supported areas will grow

Thanks!
